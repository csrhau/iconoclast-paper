On Frequency...
It is reasonable to expect that different optimisations may have different effects when CPU frequency scaling is taken into effect. Slowing a processor's clock speed down may alter the balance of pressures on various CPU subsystems. With this in mind, it may be the case that some optimisations are effective at some frequencies but not at others. This motivates us to ask the question at what clock frequency does it become categorically impossible to beat the current unoptimised code.

The figures given by POSE also useful as inputs to sensitivity analysis.

It would be invalid to use a large proportions of the silicon are temporarily non-functional as a basis for. 
Clock gating electrically isolates processor subsystems which are not in active use.
