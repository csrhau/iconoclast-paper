\section{Power Optimised Software Envelope}
\label{sec:pose}
\noindent
Energy is the integral of power consumed over time, or put simply $E = \bar{P}t$.
As such, the energy efficiency of a code can be achieved either through shortening its runtime ($t$) with conventional program optimisations or reducing average power consumption ($\bar{P}$) with power optimisations.
POSE enables performance engineers to compare the potential benefits of each approach for a given code and thus focus their efforts on whichever offers the greatest rewards.

The POSE heuristic partitions the energy/runtime plane into areas with differing performance characteristics relative to some initial unoptimised code and input.
POSE is a general purpose heuristic which applies to all members of the $E^mt^n$ group with $m > 0$ and $n \geq 0$, and indeed any metric that increases in line with runtime and energy consumption.
We introduce the bounds which constitute POSE and provide their derivations for the $E^mt^n$ family of metrics.
The only prerequisites of our model are that time and energy consumption can be accurately measured or calculated for the target platform.

\subsection{Feasible Performance Envelope}
\noindent
POSE is built around the concept of a \emph{Feasible Performance Envelope}.
We construct this by plotting lines of gradient $P_{min}$ and $P_{max}$ in \autoref{fig:technique}.
These values represent the minimum and maximum rates of power consumption that can occur during normal operation of the target platform.
The \textit{(Runtime, Energy)} costs incurred by running any given code $\theta$ under similar conditions must be represented within this envelope.

\subsection{Optimisation Bound}
\noindent
To constrain our search space further we consider the metric we wish to reduce.

\begin{definition}
\textit{For logically equivalent codes $\theta$ and $\lambda$, the transformation ${\theta \to \lambda}$ is a valid optimisation with respect to a cost metric $M$ iff ${M(\lambda) \succ M(\theta)}$.}
\label{def:optimisation}
\end{definition}

\noindent
We plot curve \emph{B --- E} in \autoref{fig:technique}, which passes through $\theta$ linking all points where ${M(\lambda) = M(\theta)}$. 
By \autoref{def:optimisation} any optimised versions of $\theta$ must exist below this bound.
Naturally the equation for the Optimisation Bound depends on the metric we are optimising for.
\autoref{fig:technique} shows the Optimisation Bound for $E^1t^2$.
The general form of this bound for the $E^mt^n$ family of metrics is derived as follows:
\begin{align}
 {E_\lambda}^m{t_\lambda}^n &= {E_\theta}^m{t_\theta}^n \nonumber \\
 {E_\lambda}^m &= \frac{{E_\theta}^m{t_\theta}^n}{{t_\lambda}^n} \nonumber \\
  E_\lambda &= (\frac{{E_\theta}^m{t_\theta}^n}{{t_\lambda}^n})^\frac{1}{m}
\label{eq:optimisation}
\end{align}

\subsection{Contribution Bound}
\noindent
Our second bound considers what it means to optimise for reduced power draw.
\begin{definition}
\textit{An optimisation $\theta \to \lambda$ with respect to metric $M$ is a power optimisation iff the reduction in power draw it delivers is responsible for the majority of the improvement in terms of $M$.}
\label{def:poweropt}
\end{definition}

\noindent
We plot curve \emph{C --- $\theta$} in \autoref{fig:technique} linking all points for which power and runtime factors contribute to $M$ in the same ratio as our original code.
By \autoref{def:poweropt} any power-optimised versions of $\theta$ must lie below this Contribution Bound.
Again the equation for the Contribution Bound depends on the metric chosen. 
\autoref{fig:technique} shows the bound for $E^1t^2$ while the general form for $E^mt^n$ metrics is derived as follows:
\begin{align}
\frac{{P_{\lambda}}^m}{{t_{\lambda}}^{m+n}} &= \frac{{P_{\theta}}^m}{{t_{\theta}}^{m+n}} \nonumber \\
 {P_{\lambda}}^m &= \frac{{P_{\theta}}^m}{{t_{\theta}}^{m+n}} \times {t_\lambda}^{m+n} \nonumber \\ 
 {E_{\lambda}}^m &= \frac{{P_{\theta}}^m}{{t_{\theta}}^{m+n}} \times {t_\lambda}^{m+n+1} \nonumber \\ 
  E_{\lambda} &= (\frac{{P_{\theta}}^m}{{t_{\theta}}^{m+n}} \times {t_\lambda}^{m+n+1})^{\frac{1}{m}} 
  \label{eq:contribution}
\end{align}

\noindent
We seek to use the most appropriate tools while searching for optimisations.
If an optimisation yields significant reductions in runtime, with only minor reductions in power consumption, then it is reasonable to classify it as a runtime optimisation.
Conventional time-based profilers and performance engineering tools are therefore better suited to finding these optimisations.
It is the Contribution Bound which enables our model to make this distinction.

\subsection{Optimisation Limit}
\noindent
The bounds described thus far delineate those areas of the energy/runtime plane in which runtime and power optimised versions of a given code may exist.
The final component of POSE is the Optimisation Limit.
This partitions runtime optimisations into those which strictly dominate all power optimisations and those which could be outperformed by some power optimisation.

This limit is related to the Optimisation Bound and is likewise based on \autoref{eq:optimisation}.
It connects all points with the same value for $M$ as the maximally power-optimised point in our envelope, $C$, shown as curve \emph{A --- C} in \autoref{fig:technique}.
All optimisations below this limit strictly dominate any possible power optimisation.

\subsection{POSE Insights}
\noindent
POSE partitions the feasible performance envelope of \autoref{fig:technique} into areas with differing performance characteristics.
Area 1 contains runtime optimisations which dominate the best case power optimisation in terms of $M$ (\emph{Strong Runtime Optimisation}).
Area 2 contains runtime optimisations which dominate $\theta$ in terms of $M$, yet may be outperformed by some power optimised version of $\theta$ (\emph{Weak Runtime Optimisation}).
Area 3 contains optimisations for which improvements to $M$ are primarily due to reduced power consumption (\emph{Power Optimisation}).
Finally, Area 4 corresponds to codes with worse performance than $\theta$ (\emph{Performance Degradation}).

A key strength of POSE is that it produces quantitative and actionable insights relating directly to properties of the code.
These insights fall into one of two broad categories, which taken together allow a performance engineer to decide if power optimisation is likely to prove worthwhile.

The first of these categories relates to \textit{the benefit offered by power optimisation}.
Taking the difference in energy between point $\theta$ and $D$ gives us an upper limit on the amount of energy which can be saved by reducing power consumption.
Similarly, the difference in value between $M(\theta)$ and $M(C)$ gives an upper bound on the improvement in our metric we can expect to see from power optimisation.

The second category indicates \textit{the scope a code has for power optimisation}.
The difference in runtime between intersect $E$ and $\theta$ represents the maximum increase in runtime we could feasibly trade off to achieve a slower yet more energy efficient code.
The value $t_\theta / t_B$ represents the smallest speed up which guarantees a code that outperforms $\theta$ with respect to $M$.
Finally, $t_\theta / t_A$ is the smallest speed up guaranteed to outperform any power optimised version of $\theta$.

The figures produced by POSE are all upper bounds, and the benefits of power optimisation will be more modest in practice.
Even so, these figures are useful as they allow performance engineers to make informed decisions about where best to focus their optimisation efforts.

It is worth restating that POSE is a metric-agnostic heuristic. 
\autoref{fig:multimetric-technique} shows how the POSE heuristic varies with choice of metric using Energy ($E^1t^0$) and Energy Delay Squared Product ($E^1t^2$) as examples. 
POSE offers the same insights regardless of the metric chosen.
