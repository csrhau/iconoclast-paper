Performance engineers are beginning to explore software-level power optimisation as a means to reduce the energy consumed by scientific codes.
We present an intuitive visual heuristic which shows developers where to target their optimisation efforts to best achieve this aim.
We then apply our technique to demonstrate that for current hardware there is limited scope for improving energy efficiency through software power optimisation alone.
